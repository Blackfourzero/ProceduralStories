# ProceduralStories
Various experiments in procedural storytelling

For a long time, I've been interested in generating stories, either for the purposes of conducting a game or having an unlimited variety of stories available for various purposes.  Recently, I have finally started thinking about the implementation of a lot of these ideas, and this repository will contain these implementations as I attempt to make them work.

There are four broad parts of story generation that I have been looking at.

 - Character generation and motivation
 - Plot generation
 - Action resolution
 - Dialogue generation

Action resolution will probably (mostly) receive the least attention, since that's a well-studied problem through games.  And dialogue generation is, of course, an extremely difficult, well-studied, and maybe beyond the ability of algorithms to do in any reasonable way.
