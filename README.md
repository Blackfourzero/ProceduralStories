# ProceduralStories
Various experiments in procedural storytelling

For a long time, I've been interested in generating stories, either for the purposes of conducting a game or having an unlimited variety of stories available for various purposes.  Recently, I have finally started thinking about the implementation of a lot of these ideas, and this repository will contain these implementations as I attempt to make them work.
