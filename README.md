# ProceduralStories
Various experiments in procedural storytelling

For a long time, I've been interested in generating stories, either for the purposes of conducting a game or having an unlimited variety of stories available for various purposes.  Recently, I have finally started thinking about the implementation of a lot of these ideas, and this repository will contain these implementations as I attempt to make them work.

There are four broad parts of story generation that I have been looking at.

 - Character generation and motivation
 - Plot generation
 - Action resolution
 - Dialogue generation

Action resolution will probably (mostly) receive the least attention, since that's a well-studied problem through games.  And dialogue generation is, of course, an extremely difficult, well-studied, and maybe beyond the ability of algorithms to do in any reasonable way.

## Character Generation

There are quite a few ways to procedurally generate interesting information about a character.  A few come immediately to mind.

### Astrological Generation (`astrochar.ex`)

The first pass on character creation is a very, very old (and never researched) concept of mine to use the character's random birthday to generate an astrological profile in the European style.  Despite astrology being pseudoscience, the techniques are mostly straightforward and can be used as if the original classical planets are meaningful as people have thought, extended with modern planets, or use a completely original model of the solar system.  Likewise, the generated content could be vague personality traits or very specific abilities.  Since Kepler's laws of planetary motion are likely to be universal and the results (bluntly) meaningless except in a fictional setting, the same principles apply in all cases.

At heart, `astrochar.ex` is a sort of orrery, attempting to mimic [Kepler's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler's_laws_of_planetary_motion) to track the planets against a background of astrological (or other) signs.

It will start with the features of [Western astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_astrology) and presumably incorporate other traditions.  The result _should_ be, based on a birthday, a rough character personality concept and a daily situation.


### Background Generation (`generate.js`)

An obvious problem in creating characters is in diversifying backgrounds, especially when it's far easier to assume that everybody looks like one's neighbors.  American sitcoms come to mind as a strong example, where a viewer can still somehow watch a show set in an urban center where ten out of ten people just happen to be white people in their twenties.

`generate`, then, guesses at a random person on Earth, to take advantage of the full scope of diversity on the planet.

In short, the program uses a population density map from Columbia University's [SEDAC](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-population-density-rev10/data-download) to find a random latitude and longitude, then uses that information to find the country best represented by that location and the five nearest cities.

Note that:

 * Because of the rectangular projection used by the SEDAC maps, it's surprisingly common for selected coordinates to be out in the ocean or for the nearest cities to all be in a different country.
 * One degree of longitude by one degree of latitude is a _big_ space, but that map is used because the file has a reasonable size.  In the downloads at the SEDAC site, you can also find maps whose cells are one kilometer by one kilometer.  The existing code should at least _mostly_ work for those.
 * A handful of countries recognized by SEDAC are not recognized by the rest of the world.

Given a country, then, `generate` uses the JSON conversion of the [CIA World Factbook](https://github.com/iancoleman/cia_world_factbook_api) to create a random skeletal background for the target person based on the country, including:

 * Age range
 * Gender
 * Religion
 * Ethnicity
 * Literacy
 * Languages Spoken

Because the data is on the national level, the religion, ethnicity, and language information do _not_ necessarily correlate appropriately with each other or with location.  To explain, here's one example.
